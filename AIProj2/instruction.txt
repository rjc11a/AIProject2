1. First, compile the file "main.cpp" in this folder.

2. Run the program. The program will prompt you to enter a file name, such as A1.csv

3. The program will attempt to open the file. If successful, it will quickly scan the file 
	to calculate the length of the sack, and inform the user of the size. 

4. It will then prompt the user to enter y or n to run the brute force method. 
	Brute force is not recommended over 32 items as it will take longer than 5 minutes to complete.

5. The program will then begin running the tests. Once complete, a file will appear in this directory 
	according to the name of the file entered.
	For example, if the user enters A1.csv for the input file, the output file will be named A1_results.txt
